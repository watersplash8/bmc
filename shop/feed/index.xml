				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This completely revised and updated text, now in its Third Edition, continues to explain the underlying concepts of product management. In the process, the book equips the budding as well as the practising managers with sufficient knowledge about how to deal with different problems faced in managing any typical fast moving consumer good or durable product.</p>
<p>Divided into three parts, the book provides, in Part I, a macro perspective of the Indian market. Part II offers an analytical discussion interspersed with vivid illustrations on conceptual issues like branding, segmentation, positioning and differentiation. Part III features several new products; it also provides latest information on the products presented in the earlier edition. In addition, it analyzes the current market situation prevailing for a particular product in India. Finally, here, each chapter shows how leading companies are successfully marketing the particular product in the Indian market.</p>
<p>This well-established study has been widely adopted as a textbook in MBA programmes across the country. The Third Edition is more profusely illustrated with exhibits, diagrams and PPTs, and should be of immense utility and worth to the students of management as well as practising brand managers and executives in the advertising arena.</p>
<p>â€¢ The Student CD contains a set of PowerPoint Presentations (PPTs) of 20 products.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Use a proven combination of learning principles and exercises to make learning medical terminology easier . Now in its 7th Edition, MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONS simplifies the process of memorizing complex medical terminology by focusing on the important word parts -- the common prefixes, suffixes and root words -- to provide a foundation for learning hundreds of medical terms. Organized by body systems, the chapters begin with an overview of the terminology related to the body's structures and functions, then proceed through diseases and disorders, and finally diagnostic procedures and treatments. This helps students master the necessary language to describe how the human body works, what goes wrong with it, and how we treat it. Every chapter engages learners with the See and Say pronunciation system, interactive exercises, real life medical scenarios and critical thinking exercises. An updated art program includes illustrations that reflect the latest terms and procedures, and multi-cultural /multi-generational photos that accurately portray today's medical world. Built-in multimedia is included with the text on the StudyWare CD-ROM. This resource is packed full of activities that engage student with games, quizzes, animations, and an audio glossary -ultimately helping students study , prepare for exams, and achieve success . Optional workbook and online courseware is also available.]]></description>
