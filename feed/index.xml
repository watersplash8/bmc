				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Internship is paid employment that enables students to gain long-term practical experience directly related to their programs of study. Internships are optional in most diploma programs and range in duration from four to 16 months.Â  Students may choose to participate in the internship program prior to their final semester of study. Once the internship is complete, the students return to school to fulfill their educational requirements.</p>
<p>Field placement provides students with direct and supervised hands-on experience within their field while continuing to engage in academic studies.Â  Field placements vary in duration depending on the academic requirements of the program.Â  For more information on field work required in your program, contact your School office.</p>
