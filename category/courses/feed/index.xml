<div></div>
<p>Studies in either the Enterprise Systems Administration (<strong>ESA</strong>) or Network Systems Administration (<strong>NSA</strong>) option. Technical Studies infers programs that do not focus on design or engineering; rather the focus is on technical training. Administration training comprises both theory and practical experience where the goal is to have the students develop a skill set to be able to install, maintain, customize, configure, and troubleshoot systems and hardware. To support this training students are exposed to considerable hands-on activities using well equipped labs. Applicants should have a keen interest in computers, exposure to home networking, strong communication and problem solving skills.</p>
<h3>The Program</h3>
<p>The Computer Information Systems Administration (<strong>CISA</strong>) program emphasizes a hands-on, technical approach to training, where experience gained in labs and classrooms can be applied directly to business and industry. Successful graduates will be qualified to work in Industry as administrators of computer networks and server systems.</p>
<p>Year-one (<strong>CISA</strong>) consists of training that first introduces students to computer hardware, operating systems, and computer networking fundamentals. The program builds upon these fundamentals with a focus on Microsoft Networking, Cisco Networking, additional computer hardware including server systems, and Linux operating systems administration. The training aligns with certain industry certifications but students are not required to write any industry exams. Students completing year-one are encouraged to obtain the Cisco CCNA, Microsoft MCITP, Red Hat RCHA, CompTIA A+, CompTIA Server+, and CompTIA Net+ industry certifications.</p>
<p>TheÂ <strong>NSA program</strong>Â specializes in network infrastructure support using Cisco Systems and Microsoft products to create a secure enterprise network. Students work with routing, switching, firewall, and server technologies to deploy a reliable and redundant campus network that also supports remote access and wide area interconnectivity. Students work with Microsoft directory services to support clients including messaging services and secure remote access. Topics also include advanced IP routing, multilayer switching, network troubleshooting, network management, network security, wireless communications, and IP telephony. Students are encouraged to obtain more advanced industry certifications from Cisco Systems and Microsoft.</p>
