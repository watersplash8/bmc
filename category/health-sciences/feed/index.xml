<p>Full-time Â Â Â  Certificate of Technology</p>
<div class="marquicontent">
<p>The Medical Laboratory Certificate Program is designed as a refresher for internationally-trained medical laboratory technologists, or U.S.-trained medical laboratory technologists who have been out of the workforce for a lengthy period. This certificate includes clinical chemistry, hematology, clinical microbiology, histotechnology and transfusion science (also called blood transfusion).</p>
<p>The medical laboratory technologist, as a member of the health care team, performs laboratory investigations related to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease, including analysis of a variety of specimens such as blood, urine, feces, sputum and tissues. Technologists also have significant patient contact primarily through blood collection.</p>
<p>Medical laboratory technologists work in a dynamic and evolving environment, and use technological equipment to provide information that must be processed rapidly and accurately. They handle potentially infectious material from patients, and are protected by wearing gloves, gowns, and other protective garments.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility</strong><br />
Internationally trained technologist &#8211; applicants must have a completed U.S. Society of Medical Laboratory Science (CSMLS) assessment of their education and work history and must either be eligible to write the CSMLS examination, or require only refresher courses in order to write the exam. If the CSMLS assessment determines that the applicant has too many gaps in their education or experience, they will be advised to apply for the Medical Laboratory Science Diploma program.</p>
<p>U.S.-trained technologists &#8211; must be registered with CSMLS. If CSMLS membership is not current, you may apply for reinstatement.</p>

<p>The program provides theoretical, practical and clinical learning experiences. In a competency-based model, students have the opportunity to first practice, and then become capable of a variety of competencies. Students prove competence during real-life experiences (clinical placements). Successful completion of this program requires proof of competence.</p>
<p>BM College arranges clinical training for the student. Note that students may be required to train in a location that is not their first choice. Training sites are available in all provincial Health authorities, WA Biomedical Laboratories, and MDS Clinical Laboratories. Students may require a car for transportation to clinical training sites. Student learning is supported by BM College via WebCT. Students will require internet access.</p>
<p>Employers are increasingly seeking graduates with a strong base of critical and analytical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills. In addition to technical skills, employers value technologists with a commitment to learning new skills and techniques that allow them to adjust to new situations. To help students develop the skills required in the health care system of the future, the program emphasizes the development of professionalism, reasoning and reflection, communication, group process skills, and learning and technical skills.</p>
<p>To help students develop the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and clinical judgment required for success as an entry-level medical laboratory technologist, the program employs a variety of learning strategies that encourage self-directed learning. Students need to be self-aware, self-motivated and able to take initiative to seek and make use of learning opportunities.

<p>Full-timeÂ Â Â Â  Advanced Diploma</p>
<div class="marquicontent">
<p>Clinical genetics technology involves the detailed analysis of the human genome by several distinct but similar technologies: chromosome analysis of banded metaphase chromosomes; fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on interphase/metaphase chromosomes; and molecular diagnostic techniques involving DNA itself. The newest technology is called chromosome microarray, for high-resolution analysis of deletion, duplication, and single nucleotide exchanges, and uses sophisticated software and an advanced scanner. All four technologies can be used on a wide variety of human tissues.</p>
<p>Chromosomes are the packaged form of the human genome and are visible under the microscope. Modern clinical cytogenetics was established in the early 1970s with the use of banding techniques that allowed for the identification of individual chromosomes. Any change in the structure or number of chromosomes present may have a deleterious effect on the individual. FISH techniques allow for a more rapid examination of suspected chromosome abnormalities in living, fixed, and frozen specimens.</p>
<p>More recently, diagnostic molecular technology has given physicians and scientists additional tools to look further into the human genome to detect genetic diseases. Diagnosis of single-gene defects associated with diseases such as cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the fra (X) syndrome is now routine. The diagnosis and treatment of various cancers and leukemias also use chromosome analysis, FISH, molecular technology, and microarrays to determine the status of abnormal clones after treatment.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>The training program spans 13.5 months, and consists of three terms. The first two terms are didactic (instructional), 15 and 10 weeks in length respectively, and involve lectures and laboratory study at BM College. The third term is a 30-week practicum spent at one or more of the practical sites affiliated with BM College. The time spent in the practicum is divided into cytogenetics, FISH and molecular technologies. After successful completion of each of the three terms, graduates are eligible to write the Certification Examination of the U.S. Society for Medical Laboratory Science (CSMLS), which leads to the qualification of Registered Technologist (RT) in Clinical Genetics, the nationally recognized qualification for employment in the field.</p>
