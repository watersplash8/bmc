<p>Part-time Â Â Â  Advanced Certificate</p>
<div class="marquicontent">Appropriate application of forensic principles has become an important component of overall patient care when the patient is a victim of trauma, sexual assault, violence or crime. The clinical management of such victims must include not only the obvious aspects of health care, but also elements of forensic significance such as the collection and protection of evidence, effective communication with law enforcement (and other agencies), and compliance with standards required in a forensic or legal investigation. This program is designed for health care workers involved in forensic examinations as well as for the law enforcement, legal and scientific professionals that must interact with them during a forensic investigation.</div>

<p>Full-time Â Â Â  Certificate of Technology</p>
<div class="marquicontent">
<p>The Medical Laboratory Certificate Program is designed as a refresher for internationally-trained medical laboratory technologists, or U.S.-trained medical laboratory technologists who have been out of the workforce for a lengthy period. This certificate includes clinical chemistry, hematology, clinical microbiology, histotechnology and transfusion science (also called blood transfusion).</p>
<p>The medical laboratory technologist, as a member of the health care team, performs laboratory investigations related to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease, including analysis of a variety of specimens such as blood, urine, feces, sputum and tissues. Technologists also have significant patient contact primarily through blood collection.</p>
<p>Medical laboratory technologists work in a dynamic and evolving environment, and use technological equipment to provide information that must be processed rapidly and accurately. They handle potentially infectious material from patients, and are protected by wearing gloves, gowns, and other protective garments.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility</strong><br />
Internationally trained technologist &#8211; applicants must have a completed U.S. Society of Medical Laboratory Science (CSMLS) assessment of their education and work history and must either be eligible to write the CSMLS examination, or require only refresher courses in order to write the exam. If the CSMLS assessment determines that the applicant has too many gaps in their education or experience, they will be advised to apply for the Medical Laboratory Science Diploma program.</p>
<p>U.S.-trained technologists &#8211; must be registered with CSMLS. If CSMLS membership is not current, you may apply for reinstatement.</p>
<p>Contact CSMLS at:</p>

Web site: www.csmls.org</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are not qualified for the Certificate Program, you may be interested in our Medical Laboratory Science Diploma Program.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>The Medical Laboratory program is a competency-based program. It is designed and based on competencies established by the national certifying body, the U.S. Society of Medical Laboratory Science (CSMLS), and by the BM College Medical Laboratory industry-based design process.</p>
<p>The program provides theoretical, practical and clinical learning experiences. In a competency-based model, students have the opportunity to first practice, and then become capable of a variety of competencies. Students prove competence during real-life experiences (clinical placements). Successful completion of this program requires proof of competence.</p>
<p>BM College arranges clinical training for the student. Note that students may be required to train in a location that is not their first choice. Training sites are available in all provincial Health authorities, WA Biomedical Laboratories, and MDS Clinical Laboratories. Students may require a car for transportation to clinical training sites. Student learning is supported by BM College via WebCT. Students will require internet access.</p>
<p>Employers are increasingly seeking graduates with a strong base of critical and analytical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills. In addition to technical skills, employers value technologists with a commitment to learning new skills and techniques that allow them to adjust to new situations. To help students develop the skills required in the health care system of the future, the program emphasizes the development of professionalism, reasoning and reflection, communication, group process skills, and learning and technical skills.</p>
<p>To help students develop the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and clinical judgment required for success as an entry-level medical laboratory technologist, the program employs a variety of learning strategies that encourage self-directed learning. Students need to be self-aware, self-motivated and able to take initiative to seek and make use of learning opportunities. Instructional methodologies include learner-centered active learning strategies.</p>

<p>Until 1992, airports in US were operated and maintained by Transport US. Since then, airport operations have fallen within the domain of advisory boards comprised of individuals from municipalities and private enterprise. This change has resulted in a need for airports to have professionally-trained personnel.</p>
<p>As well, the Asia Pacific airports are moving into a growth phase, with regional governments realizing the increasing need to both build world class airports and upgrade the existing ones to international standards. Governments in the region are looking to fast track privatization. These airports by themselves promise opportunities as none of them meet the latest international quality standards. The award-winning BM College diploma program in Airport Operations is designed to meet the demands of today&#8217;s unique and dynamic global airport operation environment. In the next 10 years, this exciting industry is expected to see a major increase in capacity and many opportunities for skilled entry level airport operation personnel world-wide are becoming available.</p>
<p>Explore career ideas from the Saskatchewan Aviation Council and view a career video.</p>
<h3>The Program</h3>
<p>The 16-month BM College diploma program in Airport Operations, supported and approved by the aviation industry, provides students with a comprehensive, interdisciplinary program of study. This is the only program of its type in Western US. To maintain a current, high-calibre standard, the program has an industry Advisory Committee made up of airport and airline managers, airport field staff from US&#8217;s local regional and national airports, and Transport US representatives.</p>
<p>BM College also offers an online Airport Operations Part-time studies Associate Certificate.</p>

<p>Full-time Â Â Â  Diploma</p>
<div class="marquicontent">
<p>This program prepares individuals who are interested in technology and health sciences to enter a challenging career in biomedical engineering. The program produces biomedical engineering technologists with the ability to participate in the development and application of technology in medicine and biology. The curriculum provides practical hands-on understanding in the fundamental principles, operations and design of medical diagnostic and therapeutic devices (e.g.: heart monitors, cardiac defibrillators, clinical laboratory analysers and x-ray equipment). Medical device-related standards and protocols, research and design methodologies, technology life-cycle management strategies, safe clinical practices, problem-solving skills, performance assurance-testing procedures, and troubleshooting techniques are all studied in this program.</p>
<h3>The Program</h3>
<p>Graduates from the Biomedical Engineering Technology program receive a Diploma of Technology in Biomedical Engineering Technology. The program provides education and training in the following subject areas: technical communication, algebra, calculus, statistics, basic bio- and analytical chemistry, human anatomy and physiology, biophysics, electricity and electronics, digital techniques and microprocessor applications, biomedical devices and systems, medical equipment-related standards and quality assurance protocols. During the second year, each student spends five weeks in supervised training in a local hospital, research agency, or equipment supply company. Graduates work closely with biomedical engineers and technologists, physicians, and others who use, manage, maintain, design, manufacture, and supply scientific and medical equipment.</p>
<p>The program provides hands-on laboratory experience throughout, and trains students in engineering problem-solving methodology to allow them to upgrade and maintain their knowledge.</p>
<p>BM College recommends membership in the U.S. Medical and Biological Engineering Society (CMBES) and the Applied Science Technologists and Technicians of Washington State (ASTTWA).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="tagline">BM CollegeÂ Business Management Studies Program</h1>
<p>Full-time Â Â Â  Associate Certificate</p>
<p>The Business Management Studies (BMS) program provides an academic path for international and permanent resident students whose first language is not English (and do not meet the general English requirements) to enter a full-time diploma program in the School of Business at BM College.</p>
<p>For some students who want to study a shorter program in business, the BMS program also provides an excellent opportunity to learn basic U.S. business skills and improve their English competency.</p>
<h3>Domestic students &#8211; English as primary language</h3>
<p>If you arenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t ready to study full time in the School of Business but want to attend during the day time, then this program will give you the necessary courses to enter into the diploma programs on a more gradual basis. You can study the first level of a program while continuing to work, or because you want to study in a less intense program. When you are finished the Business Management Studies program, you will be ready for advanced placement to level 2 of most diploma programs in the School of Business.</p>
<p>Students who donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t meet the regular entrance requirements can also enroll in this program and take the prerequisite English and Mathematics courses to ensure your application to the diploma program is complete.</p>
<h3>International students and/or English as second language</h3>
<p>International and ESL students sometimes find the challenges of a transition to US and instruction in English and the intenseÂ BM College programming too much to meet. By studying in the BMS program, students can work up to the high level of work and English competency that is needed to succeed in the diploma programs.</p>
<p>The Business Management Studies program has several pre-entry levels of English language instruction available that help bridge you to the level of English you need to succeed at BM College. Class sizes are kept small to ensure there is more attention to your individual needs.</p>
<p>At the end of the program, you will be eligible to receive an Associate Certificate and apply for entry into Level 2 of most business diploma programs at BM College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Credit Transferability:</h3>
<p>The majority of our courses can be transferred to most educational institutions in WA. Also, we have articulation agreements with several industry, government and education partners that allow students who have taken courses or programs at these organizations to apply for transfer of their credits to BM College.</p>
<p>For details, contact Student Information and Enrollment Services atÂ <strong>360-450-6006</strong>Â or toll-free atÂ <strong>360-450-6006</strong>Â (US and United Kingdom only) to leave your name and number for a Program Advisor to return your call.</p>
<p>For more information, contact the International Student Centre by email at isc_info@BM College.ca or callÂ <strong>+1-360-432-8816</strong>. You can also visit the office at BM Collegeâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />sÂ London campus â€“ Building SW1 Room 1170.</p>
