ISEP develops overall English language and academic skills. It is also a direct pathway to BM College certificate, diploma, and degree programs. Students can choose ISEP to improve their English and academic skills or ISEP Plus if they want to continue studies in a BM College program. Students who complete ISEP level 400, 500 or 600 are eligible to transfer into a BM College program.<strong>ISEP Overview</strong></p>
<p>ISEP provides training in reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills at all levels of English Proficiency. ISEP focuses on improving ESL studentsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> language by integrating English skills with business and technical contexts. ISEP also supports academic success by helping with cultural adjustment, studying specific topics, andÂ developing critical skills.</p>
<p><strong>Program Goals</strong></p>
<p>ISEP helps international students succeed in BM College programs. Attending 25 hours of English classes per week provides ESL students with more English development than TOEFL or IELTS alone.

<p>A special package of courses for those who wish to fast-track a career in the area of Customer Relationship Marketing or for those who have academic credentials such as degrees or diplomas in non-marketing areas and wish to gain additional certification as well as job related skills in this field.</p>
<p>The impact of technology on customer service, as on business, is huge. Technology has made it possible for interaction with customers to be individualized and reduced to one-on-one a mass basis. This has made becoming a global player possible for even the smallest business. It has also radically changed the dynamics of customer service, possibly even more than it has changed most other business disciplines. Customer service is an international phenomenon. It moves across borders and around the world with the greatest of ease. In general it would seem that North America is particularly conscious of customer service, with Europe going through the awakening in this discipline which the Americans went through some years ago. The rest of the world is generally catching up.</p>
