				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Coordination of Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Benefits under the two plans can be coordinated to increase your coverage up to a total of 100% of the actual expense(s) incurred.Â  For example, the student would submit for reimbursement under the student plan and submit any outstanding balance to the secondary plan for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Opting Out of the Plan</strong></p>
<p>You may decline coverage for Dental and a portion of the Extended Heath coverage by completing the on-line opt out form (see dates below). <strong>Prescription drug coverage and Accidental Death and Dismemberment coverage are both mandatory.</strong> You must provide proof of similar coverage elsewhere (i.e. as a dependent under your parentâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s or spouseâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s insurance).Â  You will be asked the name of the insurance company, policy number and the name of the subscriber.</p>
<p><strong>Print off the confirmation you receive and keep it as proof that you opted out.Â  If there is any discrepancy between the student and student insurance plan you will be required to provide the confirmation.</strong></p>
