<em>Applied Computer Information Systems (ACIS)</em></h3>
<p>Learn to use Information Technology</p>
<p>Learn computer information systems (CIS) foundations and how these technologies are used and managed in a business environment.</p>
<p>This program is aimed at two audiences; individuals currently working in information systems with no formal credentials and those interested in a CIS foundation before moving on to higher education in computing.</p>
<p>This hands-on credential is the second step in laddering toward the Computer Systems Technology Diploma (CST/PTS).</p>
<p>If your end goal is the Diploma, then you should complete Applied Software Development (ASD) before starting this credential.</p>
<p>Start by learning to be an expert end-user of a personal computer, then become proficient in typical office applications, followed by an in-depth understanding of relational database design and data modeling.</p>
<p>A wide variety of electives are offered to suit individual interests including: accounting software, IT project management, object oriented programming and web development.</p>
<p>Students may also chose electives in expert level word processing, spreadsheets, business and technical communication, plus business intelligence for data mining.</p>
<p>Successful participants will have acquired a solid understanding of the technical foundations in business information systems.</p>
<p>ACIS graduates not moving on to the CST Diploma may choose to continue on to Applied Database Administration and Design.</p>

Computer SystemsNetwork Security Administration Option</p>
<p>Note: New admission procedures effective November 15, 2013. Review the instructions carefully. View summary of the changes</p>
<p>The Bachelor of Technology in Computer Systems (CST B.Tech) is an applied career-enhancement degree designed to increase the depth of knowledge and practical skills of computer system technologists, and to assist them in widening their career opportunities or advancing in their career paths. Graduates are awarded a credential that is highly valued by the industry.</p>
<p>The CST B.Tech full-time program is also a two-year degree completion program for students who have graduated from a two-year diploma program in computing such as the BM College Computer Systems Technology (CST) or Computer Information Technology (CIT) program. Students who have completed other computing diploma or degree programs in an accredited college or university, whether locally or internationally, can usually be admitted into the program with only a few bridging courses.</p>
<p>The specialty areas for the September 2014 Intake are:</p>
<p>Network Security Administration<br />
Games Development<br />
The Network Security Administration Option is designed to prepare graduates to plan, manage and secure network infrastructures in business environments. The program includes knowledge and skill development in business communications and leadership, as well as the essential technical knowledge components, with a focus on establishing a set of advanced skills encompassing three key areas of network administration and network security.</p>
<p>The first component addresses the basic issues of network infrastructure, including the configuration, deployment and management of key network components such as servers and control devices. Also covered are the practices of securing systems and services, system monitoring for performance, and customizing kernels for specialized applications.</p>
<p>The second general component addresses the more advanced issues of deploying network defenses. Topics covered are the design and implementation of firewalls, Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems, and perimeter designs. Courses will provide practical skills in the area of network forensics and &#8220;real-world&#8221; network traffic analysis using a variety of tools.</p>
<p>The third general component primarily deals with network vulnerabilities and exploits. Students will acquire hands-on experience with network penetration tools and frameworks. Topics include network reconnaissance techniques, identifying vulnerabilities, and carrying out network penetration exercises. Attacks and exploits such as packet sniffing, social engineering, phishing, malware, covert channels, and Trojans will be covered. The use of Honeynets and Wargames in understanding how to mitigate network threats and vulnerabilities will be covered.</p>
<p>For more information on the CST BTech program please visit our full-time site and/or the part-time site.</p>
<p>This program is also offered in a part-time format.</p>
