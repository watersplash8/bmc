Web and Mobile Application Development</p>
<p>Create Web-based Software</p>
<p>Web and Mobile Application Development is an associate certificate program from BM CollegeÂ Computing and is built on top of the Applied Software Development (ASD) program.</p>
<p>You must already know how to develop applications by writing code in an object oriented programming (OOP) language and understand how to build web pages with HTML and CSS before starting this credential.</p>
<p>Web programmers use OOP as well as server-side/client-side scripting tools/technologies to develop and integrate software applications, which run on web sites. They receive hands-on web application coding experience in both Java and .NET.</p>
<p>Elective options are available in Android and Mobile Applications, iOS Application Development, ASP MVC and MS SQL Server Design.</p>
<p>Web and Mobile Application Development graduates will have an understanding of several web technologies and be able to develop software applications which run on web sites and mobile devices.</p>
<p>The Applied Web Development associate certificate is an alternative credential aimed at those students who only want to build web pages and does not involve object-oriented programming languages.</p>
<p>Some students will want to complete both of these web related Associate Certificates for a more complete understanding of using multiple Web Technologies to develop IT solutions.</p>
