<p>Until 1992, airports in US were operated and maintained by Transport US. Since then, airport operations have fallen within the domain of advisory boards comprised of individuals from municipalities and private enterprise. This change has resulted in a need for airports to have professionally-trained personnel.</p>
<p>As well, the Asia Pacific airports are moving into a growth phase, with regional governments realizing the increasing need to both build world class airports and upgrade the existing ones to international standards. Governments in the region are looking to fast track privatization. These airports by themselves promise opportunities as none of them meet the latest international quality standards. The award-winning BM College diploma program in Airport Operations is designed to meet the demands of today&#8217;s unique and dynamic global airport operation environment. In the next 10 years, this exciting industry is expected to see a major increase in capacity and many opportunities for skilled entry level airport operation personnel world-wide are becoming available.</p>

<h3>The Program</h3>
<p>The 16-month BM College diploma program in Airport Operations, supported and approved by the aviation industry, provides students with a comprehensive, interdisciplinary program of study. This is the only program of its type in Western US. To maintain a current, high-calibre standard, the program has an industry Advisory Committee made up of airport and airline managers, airport field staff from US&#8217;s local regional and national airports, and Transport US representatives.</p>
<p>BM College also offers an online Airport Operations Part-time studies Associate Certificate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="tagline">BM CollegeÂ Business Management Studies Program</h1>
<p>Full-time Â Â Â  Associate Certificate</p>
<p>The Business Management Studies (BMS) program provides an academic path for international and permanent resident students whose first language is not English (and do not meet the general English requirements) to enter a full-time diploma program in the School of Business at BM College.</p>
<p>For some students who want to study a shorter program in business, the BMS program also provides an excellent opportunity to learn basic U.S. business skills and improve their English competency.</p>
<h3>Domestic students &#8211; English as primary language</h3>
<p>If you arenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t ready to study full time in the School of Business but want to attend during the day time, then this program will give you the necessary courses to enter into the diploma programs on a more gradual basis. You can study the first level of a program while continuing to work, or because you want to study in a less intense program. When you are finished the Business Management Studies program, you will be ready for advanced placement to level 2 of most diploma programs in the School of Business.</p>
<p>Students who donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t meet the regular entrance requirements can also enroll in this program and take the prerequisite English and Mathematics courses to ensure your application to the diploma program is complete.</p>
<h3>International students and/or English as second language</h3>
<p>International and ESL students sometimes find the challenges of a transition to US and instruction in English and the intenseÂ BM College programming too much to meet. By studying in the BMS program, students can work up to the high level of work and English competency that is needed to succeed in the diploma programs.</p>
<p>The Business Management Studies program has several pre-entry levels of English language instruction available that help bridge you to the level of English you need to succeed at BM College. Class sizes are kept small to ensure there is more attention to your individual needs.</p>
<p>At the end of the program, you will be eligible to receive an Associate Certificate and apply for entry into Level 2 of most business diploma programs at BM College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Credit Transferability:</h3>
<p>The majority of our courses can be transferred to most educational institutions in WA. Also, we have articulation agreements with several industry, government and education partners that allow students who have taken courses or programs at these organizations to apply for transfer of their credits to BM College.</p>
<p>For details, contact Student Information and Enrollment Services atÂ <strong>360-450-6006</strong>Â or toll-free atÂ <strong>360-450-6006</strong>Â (US and United Kingdom only) to leave your name and number for a Program Advisor to return your call.</p>
<p>For more information, contact the International Student Centre by email at isc_info@BM College.ca or callÂ <strong>+1-360-432-8816</strong>. You can also visit the office at BM Collegeâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />sÂ London campus â€“ Building SW1 Room 1170.</p>

<h3>Business Consulting Project</h3>
<p>Twice per year teams of students from the Business Operations Management Program are made available as part of their course of studies to participate in Business Consulting Projects with local organizations. During these projects students identify opportunities for improvement and use critical analysis and problem solving methodology toward the recommendation and implementation of a cost effective solution. Students prepare a written report fully documenting findings, recommendations, and implementation plans and make a formal presentation to the organization&#8217;s management team.</p>

<p>The Business Operations Management program hosts annual industry networking events for students to meet with industry professionals. These very successful events feature presentations by our students, interactive &#8216;speed networking&#8217; sessions, and lead to potential career opportunities after graduation.
